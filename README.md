      This is a Tinder MERN clone basically wherein the backend is managed by using MongoDB so basically it used to store our data in the backend, following after we can 
      access all this details by using React's Axios library which will make it easy for us to showcase our data in a beautiful way to the users. So basically React makes
      it a hell lotta easier to work with this since most of it is componentalized and helps us to remember where we should focus. 
      We also use a server with the help of Express which makes it easier to connecting and managing data in the backend and communication with the front end part.
      
      Basically this it, if you wanna check this out clone and run the code to have a look or utilise it to make it of your own use. Make sure to install and makeup your 
      MongoDB databases, if you do not know how to go ahead YouTube has plethora of videos for this.
